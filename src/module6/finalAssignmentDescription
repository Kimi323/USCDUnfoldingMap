By default, all the airports are displayed and no routes displayed.
If you click on one of the airport markers, routes out of that airport will be shown. 
Also, the clicked marker itself and destination airports will be displayed. Other unrelated markers will be hidden.
If you hover over an airport marker, name, code, city and country will be displayed.
The screenshot is an example of airport in Rabat, Morroco. (I have traveled there before :)
Click again (any place is fine), display will return to default.

Inside AirportMarker class
       1. Created a getTitle method which gets properties (name, code, city and country) of airport markers,
combine them as a title, and return the title as a string.
       2. Called getTitle from showTitle, this method draws a rectangle label with title created by getTitle.
       3. Added getId method which returns unique ID of the airport. This will be used in AirportMap class.

Inside AirportMap class
       1. implemented checkAirportsForClick, It sets airport marker to variable lastClick and pass it to showRoutesForClickedAirport.
       2. created showRoutesForClickedAirport method which take airport marker as an argument.
It uses getId to get airport id of the clicked airport, then compare it with source and destination id (can be fetched from routeList). 
If one of the ids matches airport id, this method will display the route out of this marker, then call showAirportOnRoute.
       3. showAirportOnRoute method set airport markers which are connected by the routes out of  the clicked airport unhidden.
